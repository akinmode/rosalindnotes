# My Rosalind Notes
This repository contains jupyter notebooks on my solutions to the bioinformatic challenges I have attempted on the Rosalind.info platform.
Each notebook for each challenge.

I acknowledge the efforts of the rosalind team at http://rosalind.info/ in providing the exercises on the platform. I am grateful to learn from you all.
